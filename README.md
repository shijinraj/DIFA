**Digital Id Verified Contact Programs**

**The Problem**:

A Migrant Worker who arrives at a new locality may not have all the necessary skills or training to understand what are their entitlements. The worker may not be aware of all the requirements to practice a particular trade in the locality. A contact program for such migrant worker can help bring upskill.

Carrying documents along with them to prove that they are skilled to all job sites may not be a practical solution. 

**Solution** 

A Skill verification Network (SkillNet) on Blockchain can serve as a Skill Attestation Network to prove that the workers are experienced in specific Trade. The Skill Attestation Network will also enable the worker to self-nominate/attend any available upskilling programs at contact centers in their area.

The migrant work can register themself or through a Trusted authority get registered on SkillNet.For every eligible contact program SkillNet will issue a unique DIFA (Digital ID For All) for the Migrant Worker using which the worker can attend and complete the upskilling program. SkillNet Application takes into account certain basic documents that can prove without divulging unnecesary personal information about the worker into the public domain.
